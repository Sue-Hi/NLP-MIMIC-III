       "\"Admission Date:  [**2107-7-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2107-7-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2051-5-31**]     Sex:  M  Service:  COLORECTAL SURGERY/GREEN SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis since [**2098**].  The patient was hospitalized almost annually for flareups.  His current flare began three weeks ago at which time he was admitted to [**Hospital3 9683**] for the past three weeks.  He was recently started on IV hydrocortisone and sent home several days prior this admission.  The patient complained of increasing symptoms over the weekend with severe lower abdominal pain with po intake, low grade fevers, nausea, vomiting, and [**6-26**] bloody bowel movements per day.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ulcerative colitis.  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.  MEDICATIONS: 1. Hydrocortisone 100 mg tid. 2. Two Ativan prn. 3. Iron. 4. Folic acid. 5. Prevacid.  ALLERGIES:  6-mercaptopurine, reaction jaundice.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco and occasional alcohol.  FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with [**Name (NI) 4522**] disease.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, no dysuria, hematuria, or hematemesis.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature at 99.4, heart rate 100, blood pressure 117/86, respirations 16, and pulse oxygenation 98% on room air.  He was alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.  His sclerae were anicteric.  His mucous membranes were moist.  His heart rate was regular, rate, and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen was soft, tender in the lower quadrants to palpation, with no guarding and positive bowel sounds. Rectal examination was grossly heme positive, with positive external hemorrhoid visualized.  His extremities were warm and well perfused with no edema.  A CT scan of the abdomen on admission showed no evidence of free air obstruction or abscess with diffuse colonic thickening and loss of haustral folds and multiple nodular filling defects in the transverse colon.  Please see full report for details.  LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  A complete blood count is as follows:  White blood cell count 8.0, hematocrit 33.1, platelet count 201.  White blood cell count differential 90% neutrophils, no band neutrophils, 6.4 lymphocytes, 3.2% monocytes.  Electrolytes as follows:  Sodium 136, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, HCO3 29, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8, glucose of 187.  The patient was admitted to the Colorectal Service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1888**], and he was written for a diet of nothing by mouth, IV fluids, medicated with IV steroids, antibiotics, and was given a routine preoperative assessment with electrocardiogram and chest x-ray.  On postoperative day two, the patient received a peripherally inserted central catheter line for administration of total parenteral nutrition.  He was started on a morphine sulfate PCA for pain control.  He was visited by the enterostomal nurse therapist for education and discussion of ileostomy care.  On hospital day four, the patient was taken to the operating room for a restorative proctocolectomy, diverting ileostomy. Please see full operative report for details of the procedure.  Following the procedure, the patient was hypotensive with elevated heart rate and decreased urine output.  He was infused with both his Lactated Ringers as well as Hespan for volume resuscitation.  His urine output responded marginally to these boluses.  The patient's postoperative hematocrit and electrolytes were all within normal limits except for a magnesium of 1.3 for which he was given 2 grams of magnesium intravenously.  After several hours of time postoperatively, the patient was noted to have dysnomia and difficulty speaking a Neurology consult was obtained at the time.  Please see full Neurology consult note for details.  A CT scan of the head was obtained with no abnormalities noted.  The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit team care for monitoring and volume resuscitation on a Neo-Synephrine drip.  On postoperative day one, the patient's blood pressure stabilized, and the patient was taken to MRI for further evaluation of his speech difficulties.  The MRI was suggestive of an acute left temporal infarct with no mass effect or midline shift and no acute occlusion.  Please see full MRI report for details.  The patient was further worked up for cause of the left temporal infarct and on an transesophageal echocardiogram was noted to have a small atrioseptal defect with right to left flow.  Clinically, the patient's aphasia was improving.  His colostomy was viable and putting out small amounts of liquid brown stool.  The patient remained on total parenteral nutrition with consultation from a nutritionist on staff, and the patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of closure of the atrioseptal defect.  On hospital day 11, postoperative day six, the patient was deemed stable enough to return to the surgical floor and was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit.  He was able to tolerate regular diet.  His pain was well controlled.  He was able to ambulate and had no further neurological changes or complaints.  On postoperative day eight, he was deemed in stable enough condition to transfer to home with visiting nurse services.  Addendum:  Patient underwent a colonoscopy on hospital day two, which showed severe ulcerations of the colon.  Please see full colonoscopy report for details of procedure.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Ulcerative colitis primary status post restorative proctocolectomy with diverting ileostomy. 2. Left temporal lobe cerebral infarct. 3. Atrioseptal defect. 4. Secondary hypotension, hypovolemia.  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good and stable.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with visiting nurses.  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 325 mg tablet one tablet po q day. 2. Clopidogrel 75 mg tablet one tablet po q day. 3. Tylenol #3 30/300 1-2 tablets po q4h as needed for pain. 4. Loperamide 2 mg one capsule po qid. 5. Prednisone 5 mg tablets three tablets po q day x1 week, then two tablets 10 mg po until followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1888**]. 6. Pravastatin 20 mg tablet one tablet po q day.  FOLLOW-UP PLANS: 1. Patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1888**] in Colorectal Surgery in [**1-20**] weeks, and has been the office number to call for an appointment. 2. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Interventional Cardiology for repair of atrioseptal defect.  The patient has been given office number to call for an appointment.  In addition, the patient is referred to Visiting Nurses Association Services for dressing changes, dry gauze twice a day as well as ostomy care routine twice a day.  He is instructed to take a regular diet and regular activity as tolerated.
